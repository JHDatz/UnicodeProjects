Now, they're first-time big leaguers, again being made to sing on the bus.  Sheets sang ""Don't Stop Believin',"" making him an instant fan fave.  https://t.co/REGHCgyw1E"
3095,x,0,0,1,0,8,79,vinnieduber,"ICYMI, Lance Lynn is feeling at home on the South Side. So it's normal for folks to wonder if he could be here past this season.  ""I think that some of my things that I do on the mound really sit well with the South Siders.""  https://t.co/zt5DpnX3aB"
3096,x,0,0,1,4,6,21,vinnieduber,"ICYMI, the Sox are waiting on an official diagnosis for Yasmani Grandal, who left last night's game with a strained calf.  While they waited, they talked about what life might be like without him.  https://t.co/nbwIcCj1XF"

3099,x,0,0,0,2,1,11,vinnieduber,"And this ballgame is ovah. Sox fall to Twins 8-5. Cease gave up six runs. Bats mounted a comeback try, but it didn't get 'em all the way there. Grandal got hurt.  That's three straight losses for the Sox."

3112,x,0,0,0,0,3,27,vinnieduber,"The Sox are on the board after Jos√© Abreu absolutely mashes a solo homer here in the sixth. An estimated 411 feet, touched down in the top deck in left field.  Sox trim the gap to 3-1."
3113,x,0,0,0,0,1,6,vinnieduber,"Fittingly, Babe the Blue Ox won the Minnesota animal race at Target Field. But there was a racing fish, Wanda the Walleye, that I was rooting for pretty hard, if we're being honest.  Sox trail 3-0 after four."

By saying that, it means we think he could be ready by time we go to Minnesota. It's sore, it's going to affect swinging and throwing. We'll play without him."""
3130,x,0,0,0,0,2,43,vinnieduber,"And this ballgame is ovah. Sox sweep away the Twins, who came to town and unintentionally jolted awake what had been a struggling Sox offense. With an 8-5 win today, Sox total 28 runs in the three-game series and are on a four-game winning streak at the top of the AL Central."
3131,x,0,0,1,0,1,22,vinnieduber,Josh Donaldson pops out against Liam Hendriks to start the ninth and gets quite the booing as he leaves the field at the close of this series.  The negative feelings toward the Twins third baseman are not limited to the folks in the stands.  https://t.co/BmDb6xvChL

3134,x,0,0,0,2,2,22,vinnieduber,"Vaughn smashes a ball right past Donaldson at third base, and it sounded like the ""Jaws"" theme briefly played? Hard to imagine it would have been the intro to whatever Gavin Sheets' unidentifiable walk-up music is."
3135,x,0,0,0,2,1,26,vinnieduber,Crochet strikes him out to end the inning and is rather excited about it.

3146,x,0,0,0,1,0,11,vinnieduber,"After one of the least aesthetically pleasing innings of the Sox season in the top of the fifth, they are right back in business as Grandal and Goodwin reach on an error and a double, respectively. Two RISPs for the Sox, who are down a run with nobody out."
3147,x,0,0,0,1,0,10,vinnieduber,"Rod√≥n finally out of a nightmarish fifth inning as his pitch count hits 97. That inning had everything: a walk, a wild pitch, an error, five hits, four runs. Probably won't be the South Side's hottest club, though.  Sox trail 4-3."

3149,x,0,0,0,3,1,6,vinnieduber,"After another infield single, a Donaldson sacrifice fly ties the game at 3. Twins have four hits and three runs this inning."
3150,x,0,0,0,2,1,4,vinnieduber,Now a double makes it 3-2 and things have tightened considerably after the Twins started the inning with nothing more than just one measly infield hit on the afternoon. Still a RISP with nobody out in the fifth.
3151,x,0,0,0,1,0,10,vinnieduber,Twins are on the board after Goodwin overthrows the cutoff man and the ball gets away from (bounces off of) both Rod√≥n and Collins at home plate. Runner comes home from third and slides around Rod√≥n's tag attempt.  Sox lead trimmed to 3-1.

3153,x,0,0,1,1,11,149,vinnieduber,"Liam Hendriks and Josh Donaldson were teammates with the Blue Jays in 2015. Let's just say that Donaldson's behavior toward the Sox the last few days hasn't changed Hendriks' opinion of the guy.  ""I am not a Donaldson fan.""  https://t.co/BmDb6xvChL"
3154,x,0,0,0,6,6,42,vinnieduber,Moncada is out of the game after the apparent wrist issue running the bases in the third inning. Andrew Vaughn is at third base for the Sox.
3155,x,0,0,0,0,3,27,vinnieduber,Sox get another run on a Sheets sac fly. And what looked to be an inning-ending double play is avoided when umps rule that Donaldson got in the way of Grandal's return trip to second base.  It's 3-0 in the third.

3158,x,0,0,0,2,3,24,vinnieduber,Moncada takes an ugly looking slide into third base when motoring there from first on an Abreu single. Looks like he landed funnily on his right wrist. Trainer giving him a long looksee.
3159,x,0,0,0,0,2,19,vinnieduber,Gavin Sheets smokes an opposite-field double off the left-field wall. His hot start continues.
3160,x,0,0,0,1,3,27,vinnieduber,"Brian Goodwin with his second homer in as many days. Did you know he is hitting .318 with two homers, a double, four walks and seven runs scored in his last seven games? Pretty good!"
3161,x,0,0,0,1,1,12,vinnieduber,A terrific double play by Andrelton Simmons cancels the stew. Fabulous defense there by the Twins shortstop.

3164,x,0,0,0,5,0,9,vinnieduber,"Yo√°n Moncada has had trouble at third base in the first inning. Couldn't get a grounder out of his glove, leading to an infield hit. Now an error as a grounder eats him up.  Tiles totaled with Twins."
3165,x,0,0,0,2,1,5,vinnieduber,"He walks, ending his first-inning homer streak this series. I mean, unless the Twins are gonna send 11 guys to the plate this inning."

3176,x,0,0,0,2,5,65,vinnieduber,"And this ballgame is ovah. Donaldson talked, Donaldson homered, then the Sox blasted the Twins, 13-3. Sox hit six homers, including two by Grandal. The offensive cure they craved during that losing stretch? Facing the Twins, apparently.  They go for the sweep tomorrow afternoon."
3177,x,0,0,0,0,1,8,vinnieduber,"Because eight home runs were not enough for one game, the Twins have contributed the night's ninth. It does little to impact the score, which is now 13-3, in favor of the Sox, in the eighth inning."

3182,x,0,0,0,0,8,54,vinnieduber,Tim Anderson goes against the grain and drives in a run without knocking a ball over the wall. Bold choice. It's 11-1 after his RBI single as part of a to-this-point six-run fifth inning.

3806,x,0,0,0,0,1,6,billkoch25,"The #RedSox figure to start Vazquez on Wednesday.  If they place Santana (left quad) on the IL, Plawecki (left hamstring) could come off. He would back up Vazquez.  Cora said they would be comfortable with Wong at multiple positions in that case."
3807,x,0,0,0,1,1,2,billkoch25,Cora said the #RedSox have no position players with them on the taxi squad.   Boston thinks it's unlikely they could have a position player in Anaheim for the 4:07 pm EDT start.  Any further roster moves likely will wait until after the off day on Thursday.
3808,x,0,0,0,1,0,0,billkoch25,Cora said the #RedSox could activate Plawecki (left hamstring) if they need an extra man. He's on the trip and has been going through baseball activities.
3809,x,0,0,0,1,0,0,billkoch25,Cora said it's a left quad for Santana. He's receiving treatment.   'Speed is part of his game.'  'We've got to be very careful.' #RedSox

3812,x,0,0,0,1,0,1,billkoch25,Cora on the Lagares catch to rob Bogaerts -- 'That's a home run.'  'It changed the game right there.' #RedSox
3813,x,0,0,0,1,0,1,billkoch25,"Alex Cora said Stassi and Fletcher were obvious problems for Eovaldi. Otherwise he felt like his starter performed reasonably well and had good stuff.   'It happened fast. Three pitches, they scored one. Then Stassi with the big swing.' #RedSox"

3817,x,0,0,0,0,0,6,billkoch25,"Mike Mayers has the 8th for the Angels with a 5-2 lead.  A rare double switch in an AL game, as Jack Mayfield comes in at 3B and will bat second. Mayers enters in Phil Gosselin's spot -- he was the second out of the 7th.  These things only happen on Shohei Ohtani nights. #RedSox"
3818,x,0,0,0,1,0,2,billkoch25,Bobby Dalbec enters at 1B. Danny Santana is out.  Looked like Santana reached for his left groin. Rather forlorn look as he went down the tunnel toward the clubhouse. #RedSox

3820,x,0,0,0,0,0,2,billkoch25,"David Fletcher is now 4-for-4 after that infield dribbler goes for an RBI single. It's 5-2 in the 6th.  Not much of a hit, but balls in play matter. That was a nasty hook from Brandon Workman and Fletcher stayed on it just long enough to nub it. #RedSox"
3821,x,0,0,0,0,0,1,billkoch25,"Nathan Eovaldi had Luis Rengifo 1-and-2, buzzed a fastball high and then hit him on the foot with a breaking ball. What a mess.  Brandon Workman enters with the bases loaded and faces a 4-2 deficit in the 6th. #RedSox"
3822,x,0,0,0,0,0,2,billkoch25,"I'd imagine Luis Rengifo will be the last batter for Nathan Eovaldi. His next pitch will be his 100th, and I can't see him facing David Fletcher (3-for-3) for a fourth time. #RedSox"
3823,x,0,0,0,0,0,1,billkoch25,"Jose Iglesias looks out -- and he is. Good challenge by the #RedSox.  The downside -- a run scored. It's 4-2 in the 6th, as the Angels restore their two-run lead."

3828,x,0,0,0,0,2,10,billkoch25,All-Star pitchers looking very hittable here in the 1st. Nathan Eovaldi gives up two bullet doubles and it's 1-1.  Shohei Ohtani gets that run back for himself. #RedSox
3829,x,0,1,0,1,1,4,billkoch25,"Three different pitches -- cutter, fastball, splitter -- but all relatively in the same spot (3, 4, 5). Shohei Ohtani was fortunate that stayed in the yard.  J.D. Martinez makes it 1-0 in the 1st on a sacrifice fly. #RedSox  https://t.co/u5HA0mU2mK"
