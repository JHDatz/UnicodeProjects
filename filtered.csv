x,0,0,0,1,0,3,billkoch25,Cora said Arroyo (right knee contusion) is traveling to Anaheim today and will go through a light workout. He should be activated off the IL on Monday. #RedSox
x,0,0,0,1,0,2,billkoch25,Cora said sitting Hernandez for a few games allowed him 'to see the game from the dugout' and 'kind of slowed him down.'  Sees him controlling the strike zone better and pressing less. #RedSox
x,0,0,0,2,0,0,billkoch25,Cora said he felt like Andriese's fastball played better early in the season. They'd like to see him locate it better when he tries to go up.  Andriese has a 7.99 ERA in 16 appearances since May 1. #RedSox

x,0,0,0,1,0,1,billkoch25,@SPChrisHatfield I think that's a fair assessment. Just thinking in terms of comparison to the decision after 2020. He actually will have some legitimate leverage with a good year behind him and a possible 30 bidders instead of 15.
