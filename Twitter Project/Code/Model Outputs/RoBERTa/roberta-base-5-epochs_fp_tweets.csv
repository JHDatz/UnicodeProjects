1,82,"Earlier today, we welcomed #HOPEWeek honoree Blake Wheatley, an 11-year-old baseball fanatic and player, who was diagnosed with a bicuspid aortic valve condition ‚Äì the same condition that Aaron Boone faces. Blake got a tour of Yankee Stadium and played catch with Boone today.  https://t.co/1O2z0FVgBt"
2,160,#Brewers catcher Manny Pina takes a pitch from Lauer mostly on his bare hand and is being checked. Will stay in the game but that had to smart.
3,307,@NetcoRecruiter once you're sent down you can't come back for 10 days unless it's for an injured player.

11,877,Off-day for Miggy. On-day for Harold.  https://t.co/uEuirSM9h2
12,911,He's 3 for 18 on this trip with nine strikeouts. Nobody is against him. But the #Brewers don't want him to bury himself again and needed a LH option to allow him some time off if needed. It's providing another option at 1B if needed while Vogelbach is injured.
13,998,#RedSox taking BP.  https://t.co/iAIPvZMxVA
14,1214,"Dylan Floro on how his arm's feeling after throwing 63 pitches the last two nights: ""It's still on me, so that's good. It's hanging a little bit but we'll be all right.""  #Marlins"

18,1315,LaMonte Wade Jr. was scratched with a hand strain:  Mike Yastrzemski - RF Alex Dickerson - LF Wilmer Flores - 3B Brandon Crawford - SS Darin Ruf - 1B Steven Duggar - CF Donovan Solano - 2B Curt Casali - C Logan Webb - RHP

20,1446,"Jimenez '200 percent' healthy, near ChiSox return  https://t.co/yhYpBzjA3D"
21,1527,"@mpicardi @ohhenryboy @appages Yeah, that reasoning is off. Braxton Garrett and Nick Neidert are the only non-injured 40-man starting pitchers with MLB experience not here. Garrett pitched tonight at Triple-A, so he could've been an option. The issue lies in losing a reliever or going with a short bench."
22,1531,"Carlos Carrasco's ""fastball velocity was similar to where it is mid-season"" in his first bullpen session throwing off the rubber, per Luis Rojas."
23,1818,"For the 2nd time this season, the Yankees, who reached the 85% vax threshold among key staff &amp; players, have multiple positives on their squad.

30,2183,"Gleyber Torres‚Äô case earlier this season was a false positive, Aaron Boone said."
31,2463,Altuve had already been told he was off today so he didn't throw or hit during BP. My guess is Baker thought switching his off day last minute from today to tomorrow would leave him ill-prepared.
32,2908,Cora said Houck is feeling good after his start Sunday. He also said they were discussing things roster-wise earlier today. (Bloom actually called Cora mid media session and Cora told him he'd call back.)  Here's the latest on Houck's status  https://t.co/Kmtp2Apcd6

35,3314,"@turf_burner @AstrosFuture They could do that if they recalled them first, which would guarantee them MLB pay/service time while out. Teams generally don't want to do that. The 60-day IL is a major league IL. If you're injured while in the minors, you're a minor leaguer for IL purposes."
