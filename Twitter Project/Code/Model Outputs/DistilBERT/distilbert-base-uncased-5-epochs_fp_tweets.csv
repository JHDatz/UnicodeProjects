0,52,"Now here comes Brad Brach for the Reds. If you knew he was on the Reds, bravo to you."
1,82,"Earlier today, we welcomed #HOPEWeek honoree Blake Wheatley, an 11-year-old baseball fanatic and player, who was diagnosed with a bicuspid aortic valve condition – the same condition that Aaron Boone faces. Blake got a tour of Yankee Stadium and played catch with Boone today.  https://t.co/1O2z0FVgBt"
2,157,You knew AJ was due for regression: he wasn't going to have a 0.83 ERA again. But him being barely usable has been a huge let down.
3,160,#Brewers catcher Manny Pina takes a pitch from Lauer mostly on his bare hand and is being checked. Will stay in the game but that had to smart.
4,342,Tomorrow the #Rays are expected to add INF Vidal Bruján to the active roster per MLB's 27th Man Rule.
5,381,"Dave Martinez says there will be no limitations on Erick Fedde tonight. Expanding on that, Martinez said that Fedde basically just missed one start and his oblique has felt good for a bit."
6,470,"Corey Seager has started swinging again, Dave Roberts said. Expectation is for him to be back sometime shortly after the All-Star break."
7,872,"Rockies today designated pitcher Ryan Castellani for assignment. He debuted last season with an impressive start at Seattle, but he's been struggling this season in AAABQ. Rox also claimed lefty starter Bernardo Flores Jr. from the Cardinals and sent him to the Isotopes."
8,911,He's 3 for 18 on this trip with nine strikeouts. Nobody is against him. But the #Brewers don't want him to bury himself again and needed a LH option to allow him some time off if needed. It's providing another option at 1B if needed while Vogelbach is injured.
9,1234,Luis Rojas' answer when asked if he's relieved the Mets did not sign Trevor Bauer: “You know what I’m happy for? That we signed Taijuan Walker. I’m really excited for that. He’s been one of those guys that’s led us to have that camaraderie. He’s just an outstanding person.”
10,1281,"Bob Melvin and a trainer went out to check on Pinder, who walked slowly back to the A's dugout but under his own power."
11,1283,"@rogerhuffman86 There is an injury report every Wednesday, regardless of whether the Pirates are on a winning streak or losing streak."
12,1315,LaMonte Wade Jr. was scratched with a hand strain:  Mike Yastrzemski - RF Alex Dickerson - LF Wilmer Flores - 3B Brandon Crawford - SS Darin Ruf - 1B Steven Duggar - CF Donovan Solano - 2B Curt Casali - C Logan Webb - RHP
13,1325,"Buster Posey has been scratched, though no reason has been given:   Austin Slater - LF Darin Ruf - 1B Mike Yastrzemski  - RF Wilmer Flores - 3B Brandon Crawford - SS Donovan Solano - 2B Curt Casali - C Mauricio Dubon -CF Johnny Cueto - RHP"
14,1527,"@mpicardi @ohhenryboy @appages Yeah, that reasoning is off. Braxton Garrett and Nick Neidert are the only non-injured 40-man starting pitchers with MLB experience not here. Garrett pitched tonight at Triple-A, so he could've been an option. The issue lies in losing a reliever or going with a short bench."
15,1818,"For the 2nd time this season, the Yankees, who reached the 85% vax threshold among key staff &amp; players, have multiple positives on their squad. From MLB:   (I erroneously tweeted earlier that the Yankees had a game postponed b/c of positive cases before. They didn't &amp; played on.)  https://t.co/hIsUFQNXDj"
16,1848,Arroyo said it took two days to walk normally after his collision in Tampa Bay. He started to feel better after a couple more days. #RedSox
17,1999,Brandon Marsh homered in his first at-bat back at Triple-A Salt Lake. He had been out since June 1 with right shoulder inflammation.
18,2003,Zach Plesac threw a 32-pitch bullpen session today with no restrictions/complications.
19,2183,"Gleyber Torres’ case earlier this season was a false positive, Aaron Boone said."
20,2225,Zack Wheeler won't face Javy Báez tonight. Cubs just scratched him.
21,2272,Jack Mayfield is in at third base for the Angels. He played two games for LAA in April. Then he was DFA'd and played in 11 games for the Mariners. Then he was DFA'd and is now back with the Angels.
22,2294,No move... so Santana and Marwin both active despite likely being unavailable.  Plawecki likely activated with Wong going down Friday...
23,2400,Brian Cashman: All positives and expected positives all within the player ranks.
24,2426,"Sale will throw another live BP on Wednesday.   Cora: ""You start thinking ahead of when he's going to contribute."""
25,2463,Altuve had already been told he was off today so he didn't throw or hit during BP. My guess is Baker thought switching his off day last minute from today to tomorrow would leave him ill-prepared.
26,2488,"Jose Ureña would have normally pitched Sunday (with Peralta on Saturday).  Instead, they're going with Peralta on Sunday and a bullpen day on Saturday.  Hinch said Ureña is next slated to pitch on July 16 when the Tigers return from the ASB."
27,2723,"Eric Lauer, who graduated top of his class from the Jorge De La Rosa School of Taking Your Sweet Ass Time on the Mound, held the Rockies to just two hits through six. He's been relieved. Brewers up 5-0 on the Rockies..."
28,3174,"Patrick Wisdom takes over at third for Bryant, whose hand got stepped on as he slid back in to second on a line drive in the first."
29,3314,"@turf_burner @AstrosFuture They could do that if they recalled them first, which would guarantee them MLB pay/service time while out. Teams generally don't want to do that. The 60-day IL is a major league IL. If you're injured while in the minors, you're a minor leaguer for IL purposes."
