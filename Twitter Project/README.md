# 1st Place Winner of Unicode ML Summer Course 2021 - Gathering and Classification of Sports Injury Data

This directory contains the twitter bot project submitted to *Unicode Research*,
an online teaching and research organization which provides classes and competitions
for students to engage in.

The goal of this project is to create a computer program that can classify injury
reports from twitter data in Baseball. The best model found currently is an XLNet Deep
Learning Neural Network. The long-term goal of this project is to collect all injury 
data possible for sports players so that a more direct analysis of the impact of 
injuries can be completed.

Among all applicants, this project won 1st place for its analysis and potential impact.

The score most valued for our use case was the sensitivity, so we label the best
"classical" machine learning model and best neural net model with bold text. All 
models were trained on a dataset of approximately 8,000 class 0 labelings and
3,000 class 1 labelings for purposes of direct comparison.
