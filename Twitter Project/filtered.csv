x,0,0,0,0,0,27,dougherty_jesse,Josh Harrison seems to be 100 percent sure that he was safe at second on that steal attempt. Umps are reviewing. Harrison seems to have a point.
x,0,0,0,1,3,39,dougherty_jesse,"Alcides Escobar keeps having productive ABs. So far tonight: Nine-pitch plate appearance to star the game, a successful safety squeeze and a single with one out in the fourth."

x,0,0,0,0,0,10,zhbuchanan,This game has featured just about everything that's gone wrong for the Diamondbacks this season. The starting pitcher can't escape the second. The offense has yet to score. Baffling defensive screw-ups.

x,0,0,0,1,0,3,zhbuchanan,"Notably, were he traded to an AL team before the break, he wouldn't be able to play in the All-Star Game. (See: Samardzija, Jeff) That'd be a particularly cruel way to make him say goodbye."
x,0,0,0,1,4,22,zhbuchanan,"They never announced it, but Josh VanMeter took over at third for Eduardo Escobar to start the bottom of the third. Perhaps getting Escobar some rest with a nine-run deficit, and before the All-Star Game. Escobar has been nursing a quad injury for a few weeks."
